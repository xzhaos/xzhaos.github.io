<p>Say what you will about Elon Musk, but when the technological disrupter sets his mind to something, he plays to win.</p>
<p>Founded only in July of last year, his latest artificial intelligence startup, xAI, just brought a new supercomputer dubbed Colossus online during the Labor Day weekend designed to train its large language model (LLM) known as Grok, a rival to Open AI’s better known GPT-4.</p>
<p>While Grok is limited to paying subscribers of Musk’s X social media platform, many Tesla experts speculate it will eventually form the artificial intelligence powering the EV manufacturer’s humanoid robot Optimus.

<p>Most companies are struggling to move their generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) projects from initial stages into production, according to a report by consulting giant Deloitte. </p>
<p>&quot;70% of respondents said their organization has moved 30% or fewer of their Generative AI experiments into production,&quot; according to lead author Jim Rowan and team in the latest installment of the firm&#39;s &#39;The State of Generative AI in the Enterprise&#39; report series.</p>

<p>High expectation of Gen AI will eventually hit reality. Maybe the ecosystem of AI is not mature enough yet to support production use for many use cases yet. </p>

<p>Companies are &quot;struggling&quot; to find value in the generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) projects they have undertaken and one-third of initiatives will end up getting abandoned, according to a recent report by analyst Gartner.</p>
<p>&quot;After last year&#39;s hype, executives are impatient to see returns on Gen AI investments, yet organizations are struggling to prove and realize value. As the scope of initiatives widen, the financial burden of developing and deploying Gen AI models is increasingly felt,&quot; stated Gartner&#39;s distinguished analyst Rita Sallam in a press release summarizing the research findings.</p>

<p>A new study suggests that more than 57% of the content available on the internet is generated content.</p>
<p>AI tools like Copilot and ChatGPT depend on information from the internet for training, but the infiltration of AI-generated content into the internet limits their scope, leading to inaccurate responses and misinformation.</p>
<p>If copyright law prohibits training AI models using copyrighted content, the responses generated using chatbots will likely worsen and become more inaccurate.

<p>Just because Gen AI can &quot;learn&quot; from human, it cannot replace human&#39;s creativity. If more and more content in the public are created by AI bots, the average quality of content on the internet may degrade. </p>

<p>Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo told Forbes the company inquired with the Justice Department and has “not been subpoenaed,” noting Nvidia is “happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported Tuesday a subpoena was sent to Nvidia and other unnamed technology companies, citing unnamed people familiar with the investigation and reporting the Justice Department’s San Francisco office was spearheading the probe.</p>

<p>You.com, the AI-powered search and productivity platform, announced today it has raised $50 million in Series B funding, marking a significant shift in the enterprise AI landscape. Georgian led the round, with participation from tech giants Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures, in addition to Day One Ventures, bringing You.com’s total funding to $99 million. This investment highlights the growing demand for AI solutions that can demonstrably enhance workplace productivity.</p>
<p>Richard Socher, former chief scientist at Salesforce and a renowned figure in natural language processing, founded You.com in 2021. The company is pioneering a new category in the AI space: “productivity engines.” These tools aim to revolutionize how knowledge workers interact with information and complete complex tasks.</p>

<h2 id="the-generative-ai-hype-is-almost-over-whats-next"><a class="header-link" href="#the-generative-ai-hype-is-almost-over-whats-next"></a>The Generative AI Hype Is Almost Over. What’s Next?</h2>
<p>A recent RAND Corporation report showed that 80% of AI projects fail. That’s twice the failure rate of other information technology projects. Nonetheless, ChatGPT—the company that kicked off the Generative AI frenzy two years ago—is expected to get a $100bn valuation once it closes its next funding round. Surprised? Don’t be.</p>
<p>The hype around new technologies usually continues even if they do not deliver on their initial promise- up to a point. According to the Gartner hype cycle, inflated expectations will be followed by a trough of disillusionment. Generative AI (GenAI) is probably at this turning point right now, a Gartner report in June suggested. This does not mean that the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been real, but it alerts us to the difficulty of translating technology into economic growth engines. We simply expect too much in too soon.</p>
