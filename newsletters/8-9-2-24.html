<p>In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, partnerships and competition often intertwine unexpectedly. Such is the case with Microsoft and OpenAI, two giants in the AI space whose relationship has become increasingly complex. While their long-term partnership remains intact, recent developments have sparked discussions about emerging competitive dynamics between the two companies.</p>
<p>Microsoft and OpenAI&#39;s partnership dates back to 2019, when the tech giant invested its first $1 billion in the AI research company. This relationship deepened in January 2023, with Microsoft committing to a reported $10 billion investment, solidifying its position as OpenAI&#39;s largest investor and exclusive cloud provider.</p>

<p>To control its destiny, Microsoft has no choice but develop its own models rather than relying on OpenAI. </p>

<p>John Schulman, one of OpenAI’s co-founders, has left the company for rival AI startup Anthropic. Meanwhile, OpenAI president and fellow co-founder Greg Brockman is taking an extended leave through the end of the year to “relax and recharge,” the company confirmed.</p>
<p>Schulman, who played a crucial role in developing ChatGPT and led OpenAI&#39;s reinforcement training organization, announced his departure on social media. He emphasized that his decision was personal, driven by a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment and engage in more hands-on technical work. Schulman stated, &quot;I&#39;ve decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and do research alongside people deeply engaged with the topics I&#39;m most interested in.&quot;</p>

<p>OpenAI is rapidly losing top talents. This could be worrying to its growth and stability. This also reflects the potential disagreements among top leadership in the company. </p>
<h2 id="experts-warn-ai-bubble-may-soon-burst"><a class="header-link" href="#experts-warn-ai-bubble-may-soon-burst"></a>Experts warn AI bubble may soon burst</h2>
<p>The surging growth in demand for AI products and the hype surrounding them has driven technology stocks to new highs in the last year, but now experts suggest the AI bubble is bursting.</p>
<p>This comes after Monday (August 5) saw a substantial one-day crash on the stock exchange, with AI-related businesses heavily impacted.</p>
<p>The ‘Magnificient Seven’ which includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla saw a combined loss of more than $650 billion in market cap.</p>

<p>Stock market gyration is nothing to worry about. However, there are doubts whether AI can meet the great expectations ChatGPT helped to create. </p>

<p>Major selloffs at the beginning of this week had experts worried that the dam was breaking, although markets have since stabilized significantly.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the conversation surrounding tech giants losing hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization continues, with critics arguing that AI hype is unsustainable in the long run.</p>
<p>In an interview with NPR, MIT economist and leading AI skeptic Daron Acemoglu made a case that the tech is simply far too dumb to have a major impact.</p>
<p>When asked if generative AI would usher in revolutionary economic changes, Acemoglu had a straightforward answer.</p>
<p>&quot;No. No. Definitely not,&quot; Acemoglu told NPR. &quot;I mean, unless you count a lot of companies over-investing in generative AI and then regretting it, a revolutionary change.&quot;</p>

<p>The major theme over the past month in Big Tech and AI semiconductors has been the durability of demand: essentially, what is Big Tech’s return on more than $150 billion in capex over the last twelve months (primarily for AI infrastructure), and if the companies can generate a substantial enough return from AI products to continue catalyzing GPU demand and revenue for Nvidia.</p>
<p>Though Big Tech’s June quarter earnings were met mostly with rather gloomy reactions, management teams reiterated positivity on the long-term potential of generative AI products and services, and the need for continual investment in AI infrastructure.</p>

<p>The only winner right now is Nvidia. This reminded me that in 2000 internet bubble, Cisco is the only few companies making lots of money by providing networking equipment to connect the world. It was making $19B a year with 55% growth while Google was only making $80M that year. But eventually, it is the application and service providers such as Google, Meta, etc that make most of money from Internet revolution. </p>

<p>BILL GROSSmade his name in the tech world in the 1990s, when he came up with a novel way for search engines to make money on advertising. Under his pricing scheme, advertisers would pay when people clicked on their ads. Now, the “pay-per-click” guy has founded a startup called ProRata, which has an audacious, possibly pie-in-the-sky business model: “AI pay-per-use.”</p>
<p>Gross, who is CEO of the Pasadena, California, company, doesn’t mince words about the generative AI industry. “It’s stealing,” he says. “They’re shoplifting and laundering the world’s knowledge to their benefit.”</p>

<p>OpenAI is worried that people might start to rely on ChatGPT too much for companionship, potentially leading to “dependence,” because of its new human-sounding voice mode.</p>
<p>That revelation came in a report Thursday from OpenAI on the safety review it conducted of the tool — which began rolling out to paid users last week — and the large language AI model it runs on.</p>
<p>ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode sounds remarkably lifelike. It responds in real time, can adjust to being interrupted, makes the kinds of noises that humans make during conversations like laughing or “hmms.” It can also judge a speaker’s emotional state based on their tone of voice.</p>

<p>Do we want to be emotionally attached to a machine knowingly or unknowingly? It is not uncommon for people to emotionally attach to things such as one&#39;s house, cars, toys, etc. but AI bots are certainly a new territory. </p>

<p>A security researcher has demonstrated that Microsoft&#39;s Copilot AI can easily be manipulated into revealing an organization&#39;s sensitive data, including emails and bank transactions. On top of that, Wired reports, it can also be weaponized into a powerful phishing machine that requires little of the effort usually needed to carry out these kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;I can do this with everyone you have ever spoken to, and I can send hundreds of emails on your behalf,&quot; Michael Bargury, the cofounder and CTO of security company Zenity, told Wired. &quot;A hacker would spend days crafting the right email to get you to click on it, but they can generate hundreds of these emails in a few minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Bargury presented these findings at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, joining other accounts of the liabilities posed by AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, that are tapped into datasets containing sensitive information that can be leaked.</p>
