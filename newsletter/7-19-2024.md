## Mistral AI and NVIDIA Unveil Mistral NeMo 12B, a Cutting-Edge Enterprise AI Model

Mistral AI and NVIDIA today released a new state-of-the-art language model, [Mistral NeMo](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-nemo) 12B, that developers can easily customize and deploy for enterprise applications supporting chatbots, multilingual tasks, coding and summarization.

Excelling in multi-turn conversations, math, common sense reasoning, world knowledge and coding, this enterprise-grade AI model delivers precise, reliable performance across diverse tasks.

With a 128K context length, Mistral NeMo processes extensive and complex information more coherently and accurately, ensuring contextually relevant outputs.

Designed to fit on the memory of a single NVIDIA L40S, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 or NVIDIA RTX 4500 GPU, the Mistral NeMo NIM offers high efficiency, low compute cost, and enhanced security and privacy.

### Editor's Note:

With advancement of GPU technology and smaller yet still very powerful models, it is just matter of time that powerful AI model will run on personal devices such as laptop and desktop at first and mobile devices later on. Current cloud hosted model is similar to the mainframe computer before the wide spread adoption of CPU and personal applications. This will happen to AI models too.

## OpenAI Slashes the Cost of Using Its AI With a ‘Mini’ Model

OpenAI today announced a cut-price “mini” model that it says will allow more companies and programs to tap into its artificial intelligence. The new model, called GPT-4o mini and available starting today, is 60 percent cheaper than OpenAI’s most inexpensive existing model while offering higher performance, the company says.

### Editor's Note:

Pricing war is intensifying. This is good news to users of the AI models and accelerate the adoption and applications. Bad news to cloud providers who are hosting models as this is reducing the margin at least for short term.

## Figma explains how its AI tool ripped off Apple’s design

Figma recently pulled its “Make Designs” generative AI tool after a user discovered that asking it to design a weather app would spit out something suspiciously similar to Apple’s weather app — a result that could, among other things, land a user in legal trouble. This also suggested that Figma may have trained the feature on Apple’s designs, and while CEO Dylan Field was quick to say that the company didn’t train the tool on Figma content or app designs, the company has now released a full statement in a company blog post.

### Editor's Note:

Intellectual property is a thorny issue that needs to be resolved. This requires new legal framework how to deal with AI models trained on data which is public but not necessarily open to copy. Copyrights is not very clear if users of AI models use the generated content from these models. In general, AI models benefit from the collective wisdom of the entire human race so it is fair to collect tax on these models especially they are used to generate revenues for private enterprises.

## AMD takes a deep dive into architecture for the AI PC chips

Advanced Micro Devices executives revealed the details of the chipmaker’s latest AI PC architecture, which includes a newneural processing unit (NPU) in the company’s latest AMD Ryzen AI chips.

The company announced the latest AMD Ryzen AI processor (code-named Strix Point) and other next-generation technologies at the Computex trade show in Taiwan last month, and then it took a deep dive into the design at a recent press event in Los Angeles.

### Editor's Note:

Not happy that Nvidia is eating AI cake to itself, competitors have found new way to compete. NPU is now an emerging alternative. It is still in early days and we will see tremendous innovation in this area.
